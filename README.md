# Divisibility
A PyQt5 application that finds all divisible numbers to a specified number.
This was my first project with PyQt5 so it ought to be simple :)

# Interface
As you run the file with python interpreter, you see a window that gets a number, 
and starts processing the divisible numbers; then you can see divisible numbers.
